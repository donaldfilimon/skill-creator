# skill-creator

Agent skill for **MLAI** — Machine Learning Advanced Innovations.

Use it to create or improve skills, and to design, write, or audit the MLAI company site without breaking integrity rules (Apple framing, provenance tags, Apache-2.0, Zig 0.17-dev).

## Install

Claude Code / Codex / compatible agents — clone into the skills directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/donaldfilimon/skill-creator.git ~/.claude/skills/skill-creator
```

Or vendor it in a repo:

```
.claude/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md
.agents/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md
```

The folder name should stay `skill-creator` so the frontmatter `name` matches.

## Layout

```
SKILL.md                         # triggers + hard rules
references/01-design-system.md   # tokens, surfaces, components
references/02-brand-guidelines.md
references/03-brand-voice.md
references/04-brand-review.md
references/05-system-design.md
references/06-design-handoff.md
references/MLAI-master-reference.md   # facts + provenance
```

## Integrity in one line

Measured ● / target ○ / reported ◆ are never mixed. The only Apple sentence is *Built on Apple's public frameworks — Metal, Accelerate, Core ML.*
